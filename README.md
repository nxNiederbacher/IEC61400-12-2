# Implementation of the [IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61400) in R

> We beleive Wind power industry should engage in an open discussion  to push forward the maturity level of the industry. 

Power curve measurement is a hot topic within the wind power industry. Standards like the IEC propose a methodology to be follow to reduce uncertainties. Open discussion will push the companies boundaries to share and improve existing methodology and implementation. 

IEC standards have been around for some time, and are pushing the boundaries of the industry. We believe engaging in a open discussion with regards the implementation of IEC methods, will open the channels, create trust and momentum withing the industry. 


This initiative aims to be develop an implementation of the methods exposed at the standard [IEC 61400-12-2](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/5430) **"Power performance of electricity-producing wind turbines based on nacelle anemometry"** in R.   
Heavily inspired by the [Power Curve Working Group](http://www.pcwg.org) initiative, which focus on the IEC 61400-12-1 and has an implementation in Python in a [open sourced](https://github.com/peterdougstuart/PCWG) project. This project aims to complement this previous work.  

## Involment  
The ideal scenario there will be different stakeholders in the wind industry involved in this project. In order to gain momentum, *Nordex* & *Vattenfall* are starting the initiative, but are not limited to. In other words, any collaboration is welcome.  

## First steps
This is a first step development, the proposed steps to follow are:  
1. Document the vision   
2. Propose steps to follow  
3. Start with small initiative
