# Steps to follow  

**Objective**:  
Create an R package implementing methods of IEC61400-12-2  

Steps:  

1. Find example data sets to work with.
    + Look at the PCWG example data sets
2. Create a set of functions to generate random data of interest of a wind site  
    + Define relevant tags (wind speed, power, etc.)  
    + WTG level or site level?  
3. Share existing functions implemented in R. 
4. Have a look to Carlos (Nordex) previous analysis.  


**To Do**:  
- After adding 2 functions, give the repository a package structure.  
- ~~Clean colnames & format properly the columns at the PCWG dataset~~  
- ~~Create code book file for the data sets~~
