# Code book
This is the code book for the data sets present at the repo. It will be completed as more data sets are added.  


## PCWG data set
This data set is part of the repository for the [Power Curve Working Group](https://github.com/peterdougstuart/PCWG) repo on GitHub.  
Contains 30 variables and 11.006 observations, beeing the first one a time stamp, hence a time series.  

The specific conditions about how the data set was collected are unkown and will be refere to the [PCWG](http://www.pcwg.org) group. 

#### Cleaning code  
The raw data copy from the PCWG example data set is not formated 
This is the code to name it accordingly and format the columns.
```{r pcwg_cleaning, eval=FALSE}
load("./data/PCWG_dataset.RDat")
library(dplyr)

# Check the actual formating 
str(pcwg)

## Fix ColNames
names(pcwg) <- 
pcwg %>% colnames %>%  
  gsub(pattern="*\\.", replacement="_") %>% 
  gsub(pattern="*\\___", replacement="_") 
  
## Fix time format
format <- "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M"
pcwg$Date_Time_Stamp <- 
  pcwg$Date_Time_Stamp %>% 
  as.character %>% 
  lubridate::fast_strptime(., format = format)

## Turbine_Intensity as numeric & decimal
pcwg$Mast_96_0m_Turbulence_Intensity <- 
pcwg$Mast_96_0m_Turbulence_Intensity %>% 
as.character %>% 
gsub(pattern="%", replacement="") %>% 
as.numeric

pcwg$Mast_96_0m_Turbulence_Intensity <- 
  pcwg$Mast_96_0m_Turbulence_Intensity / 100

str(pcwg)

# Save the clean dataset
# save("pcwg", file = "./data/PCWG_dataset.RDat")

```
